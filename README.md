# Logic-simulator
This project simulates an electric circuits and the usage of the 4 basic gates - NOT, AND, OR and XOR. The code is written using object-oriented paradigms such as -
composition, inheritance, contracts and exceptions. The idea behind the project is to draw truth tables for all the gates and use them to also create new components - 
a half-adder and a full-adder. Exceptions are also being tested. You can check the UML diagram in the Logic simulator folder for a better understanding of the design.
